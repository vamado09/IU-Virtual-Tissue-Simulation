## What Is Morpheus

Morpheus is a modeling and simulation environment developed by Jörn Starruß, Walter de Back, Lutz Brusch, Cedric Unverricht, Robert Müller, and Diego Jahn at the Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing, TU Dresden, Germany. It is designed for the study of multi-scale and multicellular systems.

The development of Morpheus is supported by the DFG Research Software Sustainability programme, BMBF e:Med Systems Medicine network, and BMBF Computational Life Sciences.

Morpheus has been utilized in various studies, including collective motion, morphogenesis, and cell fate decisions. It offers model formalisms that extend beyond the standard repertoire of model formalisms in systems biology, allowing for the modeling of discrete interacting entities, cell motility, adhesion, and biophysical properties.

This modeling environment enables the simulation and integration of cell-based models with ordinary differential equations and reaction-diffusion systems. Morpheus facilitates the rapid development of multiscale models in biological terms and mathematical expressions without the need for programming code. Its graphical user interface supports the entire workflow from model construction and simulation to visualization, archiving, and batch processing.

Binary packages of Morpheus are available for Linux, Mac OSX, and MS Windows at http://imc.zih.tu-dresden.de/wiki/morpheus. For more information, contact walter.deback@tu-dresden.de.
