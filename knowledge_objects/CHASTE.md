While this interdisciplinary approach enriches the project, it also introduces challenges in terms of communication, coordination, and integration of different perspectives and expertise. Ensuring cohesive progress while accommodating the wide range of skills and knowledge can be demanding.

4. **Code Modularity and Reuse**: Although Chaste aims for as much code modularity and reuse as possible, achieving this in practice can be challenging. The specific requirements of cardiac electrophysiology and cancer modelling, the two main problem domains of Chaste, may limit the extent to which code can be made generic and reusable across different applications. This could potentially hinder the adaptability of the software to new problems or research areas.

5. **Maintenance and Extensibility**: As with any large-scale software project, maintaining the quality of the codebase and ensuring its extensibility over time is an ongoing challenge. The need for continuous development to incorporate state-of-the-art numerical techniques and adapt to new research findings requires a sustained effort and resources, which may not always be readily available.

6. **Limited Release and Intellectual Property Concerns**: Historically, academic software development has been hindered by issues related to intellectual property, commercialization interests, and the desire of researchers to maintain a competitive edge. While Chaste is open source, similar concerns can affect the willingness of contributors to share their code or for institutions to fully embrace and support the project.

In conclusion, while Chaste offers a powerful tool for computational biology research, users and contributors should be mindful of these limitations. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from the community, ongoing support from academic institutions, and a commitment to open collaboration and knowledge sharing.
