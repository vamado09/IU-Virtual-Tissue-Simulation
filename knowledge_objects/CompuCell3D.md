## What Is CompuCell3D

CompuCell3D (CC3D) is a pioneering open-source software framework designed for simulating multi-cell, multi-scale models that are crucial in understanding biological systems' complexity. Developed by a dedicated team at the Biocomplexity Institute and Department of Physics, Indiana University, CompuCell3D addresses the significant challenges researchers face in the reuse, testing, and adaptation of both their own and published models in computational biology.

Traditionally, multi-cell, multi-scale models have been implemented in programming languages such as Fortran, C, or C++, making them difficult for other researchers to use. These implementations often require users to navigate through extensive codebases, deduce the functions of various components, and extract and adapt relevant sections of code for new purposes. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, significantly hindering the progress of computational biology research.

CompuCell3D revolutionizes this landscape through three key improvements:

1. **Open-Source Nature**: Being fully open-source, CompuCell3D fosters a collaborative environment where researchers can easily share, review, and build upon each other's work, accelerating the pace of discovery and innovation in the field.

2. **Cross-Platform Execution Without Compilation**: Unlike traditional models that require compilation for different platforms, CompuCell3D models are executed in a cross-platform manner without the need for compilation. This feature significantly reduces the barrier to entry for researchers and facilitates a more straightforward testing and development process.

3. **Modularity and Shareability of Models**: CompuCell3D models are designed to be modular, compact, and easily shareable. This design philosophy ensures that models can be quickly adapted and reused for different purposes, promoting a more efficient and collaborative research environment.

Furthermore, CompuCell3D leverages Python for model development, which requires significantly less effort compared to writing custom code from scratch. Despite this ease of use, simulations developed in CompuCell3D often run as fast or faster than those based on custom code, solving the same models. The development team is continuously working on enhancing CompuCell3D's capabilities, including the addition of GPU-based PDE solvers and MPI support, to further improve its performance and versatility.
