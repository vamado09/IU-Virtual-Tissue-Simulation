## What Is CHASTE

CHASTE, which stands for 'Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment', is a software development project aimed at producing high-quality software for solving computational biology problems. The project was initiated in May 2005 as a teaching exercise and an experiment in using agile methods to develop interdisciplinary computational biology software.

The main goal of CHASTE is to create software that is extensible, robust, fast, accurate, maintainable, and utilizes state-of-the-art numerical techniques. Unlike traditional academic software development methods that often lack long-term maintenance and extensibility plans, CHASTE focuses on building a library of code with modularity and code reuse in mind.

The project is primarily focused on two problem domains: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer modeling. Researchers from both areas collaborate to develop the code, enabling a wide range of studies in cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. CHASTE is an open-source C++ library that facilitates computational simulations of mathematical models in physiology and biology.

The codebase of CHASTE includes modules for handling common scientific computing components such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). This modular approach allows researchers to reuse components and avoid the need to develop these functionalities from scratch.

Overall, CHASTE is constantly evolving and expanding its application to a broader range of computational biology problems, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field.

## Limitations

- **Fluid Workforce:** One of the main limitations of the Chaste project is the fluid workforce that characterizes academia. This can lead to efforts on the software project being postponed or even abandoned when key individuals leave the project. This could result in months or even years of work becoming useless.

- **Limited Release:** While Chaste aims to produce high-quality software for computational biology, there have been limitations in terms of releasing the software to the wider academic community. Some academic research codes have been built and maintained over the years but have had limited release due to reasons such as prior claims to intellectual property, institutional needs for commercialization, and researchers' own requirements.

- **Maintenance and Extensibility:** Traditional academic software development methods often lack long-term plans for maintenance and extensibility. Chaste strives to be extensible, robust, fast, accurate, and maintainable, but the challenge lies in ensuring that the code remains up-to-date and adaptable to evolving research needs.
