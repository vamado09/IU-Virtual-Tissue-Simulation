## What Is PhysiCell

PhysiCell is an advanced agent-based simulation framework that is designed to simulate individual cells as software agents within a simulated tissue environment. This powerful tool enables the study of the dynamics and interactions of thousands or even millions of cells in three-dimensional (3-D) microenvironments, focusing on microenvironment-dependent phenotypes. It is particularly noted for its application in computational tissue engineering, cancer systems engineering, and precision medicine.

At its core, PhysiCell agents implement key cell-scale processes such as cell cycling and death, volume changes, mechanics, motility, and the secretion and uptake of diffusible substrates in the tissue microenvironment. These processes are regulated by a variety of phenotypic parameters recorded by individual cell agents, including position, volume (and sub-volumes), cell cycle or death status, secretion parameters, and mechanics (adhesive, deformation, and motility) parameters. The framework allows for the modulation of these phenotypic parameters with cell functions that implement biological hypotheses on how each cell type responds to microenvironmental stimuli.

PhysiCell uses a lattice-free, physics-based approach to minimize grid-based artifacts, providing optimized, biologically realistic functions for key cell behaviors. These behaviors include multiple models for cell cycling (tailored for both in vitro and in vivo-focused simulations), cell death (apoptosis and necrosis), volume regulation (encompassing fluid and solid biomass; nuclear and cytoplasmic sub-volumes), motility, and cell-cell mechanical interactions. Each cell agent is constructed with a hierarchical Phenotype data structure, allowing users to model microenvironment-dependent triggers of standard cell processes easily, without the need to code these basic processes from scratch.

Designed with flexibility in mind, PhysiCell is realized in a modular manner, enabling users to extend, rewrite, or even replace its originally implemented functions to suit their specific research needs. This adaptability, combined with the system's parallelization, supports the dynamics and interactions of a vast number of cells in 3-D microenvironments, making it a potent tool for exploring large spaces of parameter values and hypotheses with biophysically realistic, 3-D models.

Since its inception in Fall 2017, PhysiCell has been utilized in both undergraduate and graduate education as a self-contained tool for computational tissue engineering and cancer systems engineering. It also serves as an independent codebase for cross-validating model predictions across various platforms, including Chaste, Biocellion, TiSim, Timothy, and others, underscoring its utility and versatility in the field of computational biology.

## Limitations

While PhysiCell offers a robust and flexible framework for simulating the dynamics and interactions of cells within 3-D microenvironments, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to the system. Understanding these limitations is crucial for researchers to accurately interpret simulation results and to guide future developments of the framework.

1. **Computational Resources**: Despite the parallelization of PhysiCell, the simulation of millions of cells in complex 3-D environments can be computationally intensive. This may limit the scalability of simulations, particularly for users without access to high-performance computing resources.

2. **Modeling Complexity**: While PhysiCell's modular design allows for extensive customization and extension, the complexity of biological systems means that not all cellular behaviors and interactions can be fully captured or accurately modeled. Users must carefully consider which processes are critical for their specific research questions and recognize the potential for oversimplification.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: PhysiCell simulations rely on numerous parameters to model cell behaviors and interactions accurately. The sensitivity of simulation outcomes to these parameters can pose challenges, especially when empirical data for parameter calibration is scarce or when exploring large parameter spaces. This may affect the reproducibility and predictability of simulation results.

4. **Learning Curve**: The flexibility and modularity of PhysiCell, while strengths, also contribute to a steep learning curve for new users. Properly utilizing PhysiCell's capabilities requires familiarity with its architecture, underlying biological models, and computational aspects, which may be daunting for researchers new to computational modeling.

5. **Validation and Verification**: As with any modeling framework, the predictions made by PhysiCell need to be rigorously validated and verified against experimental data. The complexity of biological systems and the simplifications necessary for computational modeling mean that there may be discrepancies between simulated and real-world outcomes. Continuous efforts to cross-validate with experimental data and other modeling platforms are essential.

6. **Grid-Based Artifacts**: Although PhysiCell employs a lattice-free, physics-based approach to reduce grid-based artifacts, completely eliminating such artifacts in spatial simulations remains challenging. Users must be aware of the potential impact on simulation results and interpret findings with caution.

7. **Microenvironmental Factors**: While PhysiCell allows for the simulation of microenvironment-dependent phenotypes, the representation of the tissue microenvironment and its dynamic changes is inherently simplified. The complexity of in vivo environments, including the diversity of cell types, extracellular matrix composition, and dynamic biochemical gradients, may not be fully captured.

In conclusion, while PhysiCell is a powerful tool for simulating multicellular systems and exploring biological hypotheses, users should be mindful of these limitations. Ongoing development, user feedback, and integration with experimental data are crucial for addressing these challenges and enhancing the utility and accuracy of PhysiCell simulations.
