## Limitations

While Artistoo offers a groundbreaking approach to sharing and interacting with computational models in the field of computational biology and beyond, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to the framework. Understanding these limitations is crucial for both builders and viewers to set realistic expectations and to identify areas where further development or alternative solutions might be necessary.

### Browser Dependency

Artistoo simulations rely entirely on the capabilities and standards compliance of web browsers. This means that the performance and functionality of Artistoo models can vary significantly across different browsers and devices. Users may encounter issues with older browsers or those that do not fully adhere to web standards, potentially limiting accessibility and user experience.

### Computational Power

Given that Artistoo runs in a web browser, the computational power is limited to that of the client's device. For complex simulations requiring significant computational resources, this could result in slower performance or the inability to run the simulation effectively. This limitation is particularly relevant for large-scale models or those requiring real-time interaction and feedback.

### Programming Knowledge Requirement

Although Artistoo aims to make computational models more accessible to a broader audience, including those without programming expertise, building and customizing simulations still require a basic understanding of JavaScript and computational modeling principles. This could pose a barrier to entry for some potential users, particularly those in the "viewers" category, such as biologists and students without programming backgrounds.

### Security Concerns

Running simulations in a web browser involves potential security risks, especially when simulations are shared publicly. Malicious code could be embedded in a simulation, posing a risk to users who interact with it. While this is a general concern for web-based applications, it is a limitation that users and developers of Artistoo need to be aware of and take precautions against.

### Limited Model Types

While Artistoo supports a wide range of Cellular Potts Model (CPM) models, its current implementation may not accommodate all types of computational models. Researchers working with models that fall outside of Artistoo's current capabilities might find the framework less useful. Ongoing development and community contributions are essential to expanding the range of supported model types.

### Conclusion

Artistoo represents a significant step forward in making computational models more accessible and interactive. However, users and developers must be mindful of its limitations, including browser dependency, computational power constraints, the need for programming knowledge, security concerns, and the current scope of model types supported. Addressing these limitations through continued development, education, and community engagement will be key to maximizing Artistoo's potential as a tool for education, learning, and collaboration in computational biology and beyond.
