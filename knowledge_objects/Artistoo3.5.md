## What Is Artistoo

Artistoo is a JavaScript library implemented as an ECMAScript 6 module, which can be loaded into an HTML page or accessed from within a Node.js command line application. It is an open-source library released under the MIT license and is freely available on GitHub at [https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo](https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo).

Computational modelling research involves two important, but distinct categories of researchers: Builders and Viewers. Builders are the scientists designing the models and performing the research, typically computational biologists with some basic programming skills. Viewers are members of the broader research community who should be able to access and understand these models, including biologists and students without programming expertise.

Artistoo is the first simulation framework supporting interactive simulations in the web browser that can be shared via a simple URL. It complements existing software directed at computational biologists and developers by allowing users to build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation. The simulations created with Artistoo are highly customizable, and a wide range of Cellular Potts Model (CPM) models can already be constructed using the framework in its current state.

Users do not need to install any software to run Artistoo models, as they can run on any platform providing a standards-compliant web browser. These simulations can be published on any web server or saved locally, enabling viewers to interact with the simulation and see the effect of changing model parameters in real time.

Artistoo has the potential to be a valuable education, learning, and collaboration tool in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics. It may also encourage more open science by providing accessible computational models that can aid in peer review and collaboration across different research fields.
