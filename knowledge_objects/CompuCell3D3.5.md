## What Is CompuCell3D

CompuCell3D (CC3D) is a pioneering open-source software framework designed for simulating multi-cell, multi-scale models that are crucial in understanding biological systems' complexity. Developed by a team at the Biocomplexity Institute and Department of Physics, Indiana University, CompuCell3D addresses the significant challenges researchers face in reusing, testing, or adapting both their own and published models in the field of computational biology.

Traditionally, most multi-cell, multi-scale models are developed using programming languages like Fortran, C, or C++, making them difficult for other researchers to use or adapt. These models are often encapsulated in large, complex codebases that require significant effort to understand, extract, and repurpose. CompuCell3D revolutionizes this approach by offering a solution that is:

1. **Fully Open-Source**: CompuCell3D's open-source nature ensures that it is freely available for modification and distribution, fostering a collaborative environment where researchers can share models and improvements.

2. **Cross-Platform and Compilation-Free Execution**: Unlike traditional models that require specific operating systems or tedious compilation steps, CC3D models can be executed across different platforms without the need for compilation. This feature significantly reduces the barrier to entry for researchers wanting to test or adapt existing models.

3. **Modular, Compact, and Shareable Models**: The use of Python in CompuCell3D allows for the creation of models that are not only easier to develop but also more compact and modular. This modularity means that models can be easily shared and adapted by other researchers, promoting a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement in the field.

Despite the ease of development and the high level of accessibility, CompuCell3D does not compromise on performance. In many cases, simulations developed in CompuCell3D run as fast as, or even faster than, those developed in custom code for the same models. The current development efforts for CompuCell3D are focused on enhancing its capabilities further by adding GPU-based PDE solvers and MPI support, aiming to improve simulation speeds and efficiency.
